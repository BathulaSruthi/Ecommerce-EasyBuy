# 🛍️ Ecommerce-EasyBuy
Developed "EasyBuy", a comprehensive  e-commerce website using PHP and MySQL, that offers a user-friendly Online shopping Experience. This Project features a fully functional admin dashboard for efficient management of products and orders.


**Ecommerce-EasyBuy** is a beginner-friendly front-end e-commerce web application designed to simulate a basic online shopping experience. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project focuses on essential web development skills such as layout design, DOM manipulation, and dynamic client-side functionality.

## 📖 About the Project

The goal of Ecommerce EasyBuy is to provide a simple yet functional shopping interface where users can:

- Browse products
- Add items to their cart
- See real-time cart updates and total pricing
- Remove items from the cart

This project helped me understand how to manage UI updates with JavaScript, structure a web page using HTML/CSS, and handle user interactions effectively.

It was developed as a learning project to strengthen my skills in front-end development and demonstrate how basic e-commerce functionality works without relying on frameworks or backend systems.

Ecommerce-EasyBuy/
├── index.html # Main HTML file containing structure

## 💡 How It Works

1. The page displays a grid of product cards with images, titles, and prices.
2. Each product has an **"Add to Cart"** button.
3. When clicked, the product is added to a shopping cart, which appears on the page.
4. The cart automatically updates the **total cost**.
5. Users can also **remove items** from the cart with one click.
6. All logic and interactivity are handled with **vanilla JavaScript**.
